# Flutter architecture

Reference implementation: `juanagu/flutter-clean-architecture-medium` (`docs/architecture.md` there has the diagrams and a sign-in sequence). When a project already has its own `docs/architecture.md`, that doc wins on specifics; this skill is the default shape and the checklist.

## 1. Layers and the dependency rule

```
lib/
  main.dart                 binding, injector registration, vendor init, error forwarding, runApp
  src/
    abstractions/           ports with no app dependencies: AuthClient, DataRemoteClient, FeatureConfig, Injector, Logger, Failure
    core/                   entities, ports and data mappers that two or more features need (Tweet, User, UserSessionRepository, TweetDocument)
    application/            app shell: MaterialApp + routes, theme/ (tokens, color schemes, text theme, component themes), I18n, FeatureFlags, PageContainer, widgets/
    features/<feature>/     one folder per screen or embeddable widget (layout in §2)
    integrations/<vendor>/  adapters: firebase/, in_memory/, local/, get_it/, timeago/
    ioc/                    IocManager: binds every port to an adapter per backend
```

Imports, checked by a test in the repo (see §9):

| From | May import (inside `package:app`) |
| --- | --- |
| `abstractions/` | `abstractions/` only |
| `core/` | `abstractions/`, `core/` |
| `features/<f>/` | `abstractions/`, `core/`, `application/`, its own folder, and other features **only** through `features/<g>/<g>_feature.dart` |
| `application/` | `abstractions/`, `core/`, `application/`, and `features/<g>/<g>_feature.dart` (to register routes) |
| `integrations/` | `abstractions/`, `core/`, `integrations/` |
| `ioc/`, `main.dart` | anything |

Vendor packages (`firebase_*`, `cloud_firestore`, `get_it`, `timeago`, any SDK) are imported only under `integrations/` and in `main.dart`. `flutter_bloc` and `dartz` are allowed everywhere below `application/`. Vendor types never cross a port: the adapter maps them to the port's own exception and codes (`AuthClientException(AuthErrorCode.invalidCredentials)`).

## 2. A feature folder

```
features/tweet_feed/
  tweet_feed_feature.dart    composition root (§3)
  domain/
    repositories/            the ports this feature needs (abstract classes)
    use_cases/               interface + one implementation named by what it does (SortedTweetFeedUseCase, never V1)
    failures/                sealed class XFailure extends Failure; one const subclass per outcome the UI tells apart
    entities/                only when the feature has its own (TweetDraft)
  data/remote/               adapters over the abstractions ports; map exceptions to failures, log only the unexpected
  presentation/
    cubits/                  XCubit + sealed XState (one file each); an exhaustive switch maps failure → state
    pages/ widgets/          compose PageContainer and application/widgets; copy via I18n.of(context).translate
    mappers/ models/         presentation models only when the UI needs more than the entity
  feature_readme.md          purpose, exposed interface, states and failures, data flow, toggle, known gaps
```

Folders appear when they have content. A feature with no rules of its own has no `use_cases/`; a feature that only renders has no `data/`.

## 3. The Feature class is the composition root

```dart
class TweetFeedFeature {
  static const String route = '/feed';                       // only for routed features
  static Map<String, WidgetBuilder> generateRoutes() => {route: (_) => TweetFeedFeature().buildPage()};
  static Future<void> navigate(BuildContext context) => Navigator.of(context).pushNamed(route);

  Widget build() => TweetFeedComponent(createCubit: _provideCubit, likeActionBuilder: TweetLikeFeature().build);

  TweetFeedCubit _provideCubit() { final injector = Injector.instance; return TweetFeedCubit(useCase: _provideUseCase(injector), ...); }
  TweetFeedUseCase _provideUseCase(Injector injector) => SortedTweetFeedUseCase(repository: _provideRepository(injector), sorter: ...);
  TweetFeedRepository _provideRepository(Injector injector) => TweetFeedRemoteRepository(dataRemoteClient: injector.resolve<DataRemoteClient>());
}
```

- App-wide services (logger, flags, auth and data clients, session, formatters) come from `Injector.instance`. Everything feature-specific (repository, use case, cubit) is built here, never registered globally.
- Widgets receive a `createCubit` factory and own the `BlocProvider`; a row widget that must survive list updates keeps its cubit in a `State` and feeds newer data through a `sync` method.
- Cross-feature access goes only through another feature's class: its `navigate` as a callback, its `build*()` as a widget. Never import another feature's `data/`, `domain/` or `presentation/`. A cubit never imports its own feature's composition root (put shared constants such as flag keys in `application/`).

## 4. Results, failures and state

- Repositories and use cases return `Future<Either<XFailure, T>>`, with `Unit` when nothing comes back. Streams deliver errors on the stream.
- Expected failures (wrong password, email taken) are mapped without logging; everything else is logged through the `Logger` port and becomes the feature's unexpected failure.
- States and failures are `sealed class` hierarchies matched with `switch`; no generated unions. A state that carries data carries it as a field (`TweetFeedFound(items)`).
- A cubit owns its subscriptions: `close()` cancels; a restart cancels synchronously before listening again; `emit` is guarded by `isClosed` in async callbacks. A cubit takes a clock, a flag source or a formatter through a port, never from the widget tree.
- Optimistic updates emit the hoped-for value in a `Sending` state and roll back to the previous one on `Left`.

## 5. Toggles

- Keys and defaults in one `FeatureFlags` module under `application/`; the strings match the remote configuration.
- Checked at the feature's entry widget through `FeatureGate` (child form hides, builder form hands the value to the layout), never deep in business logic. When the surrounding layout depends on the flag too, the host reads it once and passes the answer down.
- A read that fails keeps the feature off and logs; the remote adapter falls back to the defaults.

## 6. Every outside dependency has a fake

`integrations/in_memory/` implements every port in process, seeded with demo data, selected by a compile-time define (`--dart-define=IN_MEMORY_BACKEND=true`). That is how the UI is screenshotted, how CI builds without vendor config, and how repositories get integration tests with no network. A backend that cannot work on the current platform fails fast in `IocManager.register()` with a message, instead of crashing inside the vendor's init.

## 7. Design system and page shell

- `application/theme/`: explicit light and dark `ColorScheme`, a `TextTheme` on the platform font, spacing and radii tokens, component themes. Widgets read `Theme.of(context)` and the tokens; no raw hex or dp in features or shared widgets.
- One `PageContainer` owns the app bar row, the capped centred column (forms 400, content 600), hairline column edges on wide viewports, safe areas, FAB alignment and a `canLeave` flag that greys the leading icon and blocks back while a submit is in flight.
- Shared widgets (`EmailPasswordForm`, `FormErrorMessage`, `MessageView`, `PillButton`, `InitialAvatar`, `FeatureGate`, `showTranslatedSnackBar`) live in `application/widgets/`; features compose them and never hand-roll a variant.
- Forms stay mounted while submitting (read-only fields, progress inside the button, footer kept laid out but invisible) so a failure keeps what was typed. Failures the user fixes by retyping are inline blocks; the unexpected ones are snackbars.
- A list that sets its own `padding` adds `MediaQuery.paddingOf(context).bottom` back. A page without an app bar sits in a `SafeArea`.

## 8. Copy

- Dotted keys in `assets/i18n/<lang>.json`, read through `I18n.of(context).translate('feature.key')`, every shipped language with real translations. A missing key renders as the key so the gap is visible.
- A test enforces identical key sets across dictionaries, that every key used in `lib/` exists, and that every key is used.
- Formatters that depend on language (relative time) take the language code as a parameter from the widget that has a context; they never read the widget tree themselves.

## 9. Tests and checks

```
test/
  support/              fakes (RecordingLogger, MapFeatureConfig, fixed repositories, makeTweet) and pumpLocalized (390x844, shipped theme, real dictionaries)
  architecture/         dependency_rule_test.dart: scans lib/ imports against §1 and fails with the offending lines
  application/          i18n parity, validators, page shell at 390/768/1280, shared widgets
  core/                 entities
  features/<f>/         cubits with expectLater(cubit.stream, emitsInOrder(...)), use cases, repositories against the in-memory adapters, widget tests of each state
  integrations/         the in-memory adapters
```

Before reporting work done: `dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test`, `flutter analyze --fatal-infos`, `flutter test`, `flutter build web --release --dart-define=IN_MEMORY_BACKEND=true`, and screenshots at 390 and desktop for every state the change touches (the repo's `docs/development.md` has the recipe).

## 10. Adding a feature

1. `features/<name>/` with `domain/`, `data/`, `presentation/` as needed.
2. `domain/failures/<name>_failure.dart`: `sealed class XFailure extends Failure` + one subclass per outcome.
3. `domain/repositories/<name>_repository.dart`: the port, returning `Future<Either<XFailure, T>>`.
4. `data/remote/<name>_remote_repository.dart`: implement it on an `abstractions/` port; map exceptions to failures, log the unexpected.
5. `presentation/cubits/<name>_state.dart` (sealed) and `<name>_cubit.dart` (exhaustive switch over the failure).
6. `presentation/pages/<name>_page.dart`: `BlocProvider` + `BlocConsumer` inside `PageContainer`; copy through `I18n`; keys added to every dictionary.
7. `<name>_feature.dart` with `route`, `generateRoutes()`, `navigate()`, `buildPage()`; resolve app-wide services from the injector; build the rest here. Add `feature_readme.md`.
8. Register `generateRoutes()` in `Application`; link from another feature by passing `navigate` or `build*()`. If toggled, add the key to `FeatureFlags` and gate the entry widget.

## 11. What goes wrong, and the correct form

| Seen in reviews | Do this instead |
| --- | --- |
| Repository calls `FirebaseAuth.instance` directly | Depend on `AuthClient`; the Firebase adapter lives under `integrations/firebase/` |
| A port returning `dynamic` or a vendor snapshot | Typed port (`RemoteDocument {id, data}`), vendor types mapped in the adapter |
| `likes` written as a number from the client | A `likedBy` set written with an atomic set operation; the count derives from it |
| A widget created in `build()` holding `TextEditingController`s | A `StatefulWidget` that disposes them; the form stays mounted while submitting |
| Spinner replaces the form while submitting | Read-only fields and progress in the button; the draft survives a failure |
| `Scaffold.of(context)` from a listener above the Scaffold | `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context)` through `showTranslatedSnackBar` |
| Cubit imports its feature's `*_feature.dart` for a constant | Constant in `application/feature_flags.dart` |
| `StreamController` per layer, never closed | `stream.map(...)` in the use case; the cubit holds the one subscription and cancels it |
| `_ready ??= _init()` caching a failed future | Reset the cache in the `catch` so a retry can succeed |
| A flag read in two places for one screen | The host reads it once and passes the result down |
| New copy in one dictionary | Both dictionaries, or the parity test fails |
| `Visibility`-less `SizedBox(height: 44)` as a hidden footer | `Visibility(visible: false, maintainSize: true, ...)` around the real footer |
| `ListView(padding: ...)` dropping the safe area | Add `MediaQuery.paddingOf(context).bottom` to the explicit padding |

## Checklist for a review brief

Copy into every `/code-review` brief for Flutter work:

1. Every `package:app` import respects the table in §1 (the architecture test is green).
2. Vendor packages only under `integrations/` and `main.dart`.
3. Each feature has a Feature class with the public surface in §3 and a `feature_readme.md` that matches it.
4. Repositories return `Either` over a sealed failure; cubits switch exhaustively; subscriptions are cancelled.
5. Toggles are checked at the entry widget through `FeatureGate`, read once per screen.
6. No raw hex or dp outside `application/theme/`; new UI composes `application/widgets/`.
7. Both dictionaries updated; i18n test green.
8. Forms keep input across a failed submit; back is blocked while submitting.
9. Tests follow §9; widget tests pump the shipped theme at 390x844.
10. Files ~300 lines, functions ~40, components ~200, counting no blanks or comments.
